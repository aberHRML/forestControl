Description: Approximate false positive rate control in selection frequency for
    random forest using the methods described by Ender Konukoglu and Melanie Ganz (2015) <arXiv:1410.2838>.
    Methods for calculating the selection frequency threshold at false positive rates
    and selection frequency false positive rate feature selection.
